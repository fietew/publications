  Abstract                 = {Sound Field Synthesis techniques reproduce a virtual sound field inside an extended listening area using a distribution of loudspeakers located on the area's boundary. The theoretical foundations of such techniques assume a spatially smooth boundary. Non-smooth shapes, like e.g. rectangles, are however more suitable in practical applications since the loudspeaker setup has to fit into the architecture of the listening room. Such discrepancy introduces diffraction artefacts to the reproduced sound field. Consequentially, deviations from desired sound field with respect to amplitude and spectral properties are present.This paper compares Wave Field Synthesis, Local Wave Field Synthesis, and an analytically derived solution for rectangular geometries regarding thementioned artefacts.}
