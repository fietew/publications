Material for scientific publications
====================================

All publications are listed at the bottom of this page. The material for 
specific publications is stored under the 
`papers directory <https://github.com/fietew/publications/tree/master/papers>`_. 
The figures of each paper can be found the respective sub-directory ``figs``. 
For some publications, there is also a ``slides`` directory
containing the scripts for some figures on the presentations slides. Both 
should (in most cases at least) be enumerated in order of appearance in the 
paper and the slides, respectively. In order to reproduced a figure, execute
the scripts in the following order (if existent):

1. MATLAB script: *.m
2. gnuplot script: *.gnu
3. include *.tex, *.png, *.pdf in your LaTeX document

Requirements & Prerequities
---------------------------

Gnuplot
~~~~~~~

The code of this repository has been tested under Gnuplot 4.6 patchlevel 4.
Special thanks go to Hagen Wierstorf for introducing me to Gnuplot. His
`Gnuplotting Blog <http://www.gnuplotting.org/>`_ contains a lot of examples
and information about Gnuplot.

LaTeX
~~~~~

I am using pdfLaTeX, but it might be possible to get the scipts running with
other LaTeX compilers (I don't know at all). Here are some LaTeX packages
listed, which you need.

* TikZ
* PGF-plots

MATLAB
~~~~~~

The code of this repository has been tested under MATLABR2015a. Please add
the ``./tools/matlab`` directory to your MATLAB path. The software uses the
following toolboxes, which you should download and add the their path to your
MATLAB path. For specific installation instructions please take a look at the
listed websites.

* `Auditory Modelling Toolbox (AMT) <http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net/>`_
* `The Large Time/Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/ltfat/>`_
* `Sound Field Analysis Toolbox (SOFiA) <https://code.google.com/p/sofia-toolbox/>`_
* `Sound Field Synthesis Toolbox (SFS) <https://github.com/sfstoolbox/sfs/>`_
* `MATLAB2TikZ <https://github.com/nschloe/matlab2tikz/>`_
* `EKF/UKF Toolbox <https://github.com/fietew/ekfukf/>`_

If you just want to get the material of one specific publication, you may
not need all the toolboxes. The table shows, which publication needs which
toolbox.

How to reproduce Figures
------------------------

The material for a specific publications is stored under the ``papers``
directory. In order to generate a figure of one of the publications, switch to
the figXX directory and execute the scripts in the following order
(if existent):

1. MATLAB script: fixXX.m
2. gnuplot script: figXX.gnu
3. include figXX.tex, figXX.png, figXX.pdf in your LaTeX document
